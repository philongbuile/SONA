# Sona Healthcare System

> SONA (**S**tuttgart **O**nline **N**etwork he**A**lthcare) is an application for Electric Healthcare Store (EHR) with blockchain support. We apply Hyperledger Fabric to complete our solution in blockchain. With that being said, it can become more secure, lightweight and convenient for data access, management, and security.

## Sona Test Network

The first most important part of this project is the blockchain network. The test network is being introduced in Fabric v2.0 as the long term replacement for the¬†`first-network`sample. By ultilizing and customising the network for our application, we make a startFabric script in order for you to feel free to test the network within one command line.

Before you can start the test network, you need to follow the instructions to¬†[Install the Samples, Binaries and Docker Images](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)¬†in the Hyperledger Fabric documentation. Because the ‚Äúbin‚Äù folder can be different for mac user / window user / linux user. 

## Running on your local machine

In fact, our application provide you full support of the docker images and all you need is to set up bin file depend on your operating system first (this can be optional),

```bash
// read the full version in
// https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.5/install.html
./install-fabric.sh --fabric-version 2.2.1 binary
```

then run to bring up the test network: 

```makefile
make test-network
```

then run API server of the blockchain 

```makefile
make apiserver
```

Then you can access to the backend now on [https://locahost:8080](https://locahost:8080) 

and finally, install and run the frontend, in cas you need to see the full version of the application

```makefile
make install
make localrun
```

Now it‚Äôs online on [https://locahost:3000](https://locahost:3000)

## Running without network needed (if you don‚Äôt want to care about the network)

However, the network now is hosted on our virtual machine in digital ocean. Therefore, the good news is no need to care about the network. Just simply run the frontend, and it will automatically work like magic. 

```makefile
make install
make run
```
