## TEMPLATE FOR UI

This skeleton of TS UI help my team build awesome software.

Inside src:

```
- API: fetches go here, organized by features
- assets: images and other shared media
- components: reusable components (e.g: Navbar, Footer, Spinner,...)
- pages: real pages that we can route to (e.g: Home, log in), constructed from components
- utils: reusable functions (e.g: convert time, validate strings,...)
- guards: authorization guards (used to implement protected routes)
- context: create and manage context here. If uses Redux Toolkit, replace this folder with “store”
- configs: (e.g: path names, theme colors,...)
- routes
```
